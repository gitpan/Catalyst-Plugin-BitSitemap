=head1 NAME 

Catalyst::Plugin::BigSitemap - Auto-generated Sitemaps for up to 2.5 billion URLs.

=head1 VERSION

0.02

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A compete drop-in replacement for L<Catalyst::Plugin::Sitemap> but gives you the 
following features as well.

Additional Functionality:

1. Automatic generation of a sitemap index with multiple sitemap files.

2. Writing sitemap files to disk as XML (can be gzipped as well).

3. Configurable naming of sitemap and sitemap index files.  

4. 2,500,000,000 URL maximum

Even if you don't have a site with more than 50,000 URLS, this module can
write (and rewrite) your sitemap files to disk (something the original L<Catalyst::Plugin::Sitemap> 
module lacks), so you may wish to consider this module for no other reason than that.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    #
    # Actions you want included in your sitemap.  In this example, there's a total of 10 urls that will be written
    #

    # loc will be automatically resolved for this action
    sub single_url_action :Local :Args(0) :Sitemap() { ... }
    
    # see WWW::Sitemap::XML::URL for all the possible attributes 
    sub single_url_with_attrs : Local :Args(0) :Sitemap( changefreq => 'daily', priority => '0.5' ) { ... }
    
    # If you have multiple urls that map to an action, you need to specify the string '*' as it's only attribute
    # then you must specify a method with the same name plus '_sitemap' as your action method.  Within that action,
    # you'll need to call the ->add method on your sitemap.  
    sub multiple_url_action :Local :Args(1) :Sitemap('*') { ... }    
    sub multiple_url_action_sitemap {
        my ( $self, $c, $sitemap ) = @_;
        
        my $a = $c->controller('MyController')->action_for('multiple_url_action');
        for (my $i = 0; $i < 8; $i++) {
            my $uri = $c->uri_for($a, [ $i, ]);
            $sitemap->add( $uri );
        }
        
    }

    #
    # Action to rebuild your sitemap -- you want to protect this!
    # Best thing to do would be manually instantiate an instance of your
    # application from the cron job, mark this method private and call it.  
    # You could also go crazy and use WWW::Mechanize .. or hell.. leave it
    # public and call it from your browser.. your call.  I wouldn't do that, 
    # though ;) 
    # Your old sitemap files will automatically be overwritten.  
    #
    
    sub rebuild_cache :Private {
        my ( $self, $c ) = @_;
        $c->write_sitemap_cache();
    }
    
    #
    # Serving the sitemap files is best to do directly through apache.. 
    # New version of catalyst have depreciated regex actions, which
    # makes doing sitemap files a little more difficult (though you
    # can still manually include support for regex actions)
    # 
    # Also, if you only have a single sitemap, and want to use this like 
    # Catalyst::Plugin::Sitemap, see sub single_sitemap below. 
    #
    
    sub sitemap_index :Private {
        my ( $self, $c ) = @_;
        
        my $smi_xml = $c->sitemap_builder->sitemap_index->as_xml;
        $c->response->body( $smi_xml );
    }
    
    sub single_sitemap :Private {
        my ( $self, $c ) = @_;
        
        my $sm_xml = $c->sitemap_builder->sitemap(0)->as_xml;
        $c->response->body( $sm_xml );
    }


=head1 CONFIGURATION

There are a few configuration settings that must be set for this application to function properly.

=over 4

=item cache_dir - B<required>

The absolute filesystem path to where your sitemap file will be written when calling $c->write_sitemap_cache()

=item url_base - I<optional: defaults to whichever base url the request is made to>

This is the base url that will be used when building the urls for your application.

B<Note:> This is important especially if your rebuild is being launched by a cronjob that's
making a request to localhost.  In that case, if you fail the specify this setting, all your
urls will be resolved to http://localhost/my-action-here/ ... That probably isn't what you want.

B<Note:> The trailing slash is important!

=item sitemap_name_format - I<optional: defaults to sitemap%d.xml.gz>

A L<sprintf> format string.  Your sitemaps will be named beginning with 1 up through the total 
number of sitemaps that are necessary to build your data.  By default, this will end up being
something like 

B<Note:> The file extension should either be C<.xml> or C<.xml.gz>.  The proper type of file will be 
built depending on which extension you specify.

=item sitema_index_name - I<optional: defaults to sitemap_index.xml>

B<Note:> Just like with sitename_name_format, .xml or .xml.gz should be specified as the file 
extension.

=back

=head2 L<Config::General> Example

    <Plugin::BigSitemap>
        cache_dir /var/www/myapp/root/sitemaps
        url_base http://mywebsite/
        sitemap_name_format sitemap%d.xml.gz
        sitemap_index_name sitemap_index.xml
    </Plugin::BigSitemap>

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over 4

=item sitemap_builder

A lazy-loaded L<Catalyst::Plugin::BigSitemap::SitemapBuilder> object.  If you want access to the individual
L<WWW::Sitemap::XML> or the L<WWW::SitemapIndex::XML> file, you'll do that through this object.

=item sitemap 

B<Provided for compatability with Catalyst::Plugin::Sitemap.>  

Returns a L<WWW::Sitemap::XML> file containing
up to the first 50,000 URLs resolved from your application.

=item sitemap_as_xml

B<Provided for compatability with Catalyst::Plugin::Sitemap>.

Returns a L<XML::LibXML::Document> representation of the sitemap
generated by this module's L<sitemap> attribute.

=back

=cut

has 'sitemap_builder'   => ( is => 'rw', builder => '_get_sitemap_builder', lazy => 1, );
has 'sitemap'           => ( is => 'ro', builder => sub { $_[0]->sitemap_builder->sitemap(0); }, lazy => 1, );
has 'sitemap_as_xml'    => ( is => 'ro', builder => sub { $_[0]->sitemap->as_xml; }, lazy => 1, );

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item write_sitemap_cache()

Writes your sitemap_index and sitemap files to whichever cache_dir you've specified in your configuration.

=back

=cut

sub write_sitemap_cache {
    my $self = shift;

    my $cache_dir   = dir( $self->config->{'Plugin::BigSitemap'}->{cache_dir} || croak 'cache_dir setting MUST be specified in your app\'s config' );
    
    my $sitemap_index_filename = $self->config->{'Plugin::BigSitemap'}->{sitemap_index_name} || 'sitemap_index.xml';
    my $sitemap_index_full_name = $cache_dir->file($sitemap_index_filename)->stringify;    
    
    $self->sitemap_builder->sitemap_index->write( $sitemap_index_full_name );         
    
    
    for (my $i = 0; $i < $self->sitemap_builder->sitemap_count; $i++) {  
              
        my $filename    = sprintf($self->sitemap_builder->sitemap_name_format, ($i + 1));        
        my $full_name   = $cache_dir->file($filename)->stringify;        
    
        $self->sitemap_builder->sitemap($i)->write( $full_name );        
    }
}


=head1 INTERNAL USE METHODS

Methods you shouldn't be calling directly.. They're listed here for documentation purposes.

=over 4

=item _get_sitemap_builder()

Returns a sitemap builder object that's fully populated with all the sitemap urls registered.
This can take quite some time depending on the number of urls you're registering with the sitemap
and how they're being generated.  

You shouldn't ever need to call this directly -- it's set as the builder method for the L<sitemap_builder> attribute.

B<Note>:  This can take an incredibly long time especially if you have a lot of URLs!  Use with care!

This module is based on the great work of two other CPAN authors:

L<< Yanick Champoux|http://search.cpan.org/~yanick/ >> - Author of the original L<Catalyst::Plugin::Sitemap>
module.  Some of his ideas (and some of his module code) was used to make this module.

L<< Alex J. G. Burzyński|http://search.cpan.org/~ajgb/ >> - Author of L<WWW::Sitemap::XML>, which is the underlying
module used by BigSitemap to do it's work.
